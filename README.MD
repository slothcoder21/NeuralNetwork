## Neural Network only using Numpy and Math

Thanks to Samson Zhang's Youtube Video for helping me out!

This is a 2 layer Neural Network created from scratch. This means no TensorFlow or PyTorch. 

The NN was tested on the Kaggle Digit Recognition Dataset. 

I have managed to train it to a 93% accuracy but I am looking forward to adding more dense layers to improve performance and optimization.
